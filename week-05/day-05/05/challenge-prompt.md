My original answer was 3 ,because you can just split them up and then narrow the stacks down by weight.

But after the hint, the answer is 1 because:
Step 1) You take portions from each stack and add how much each should be. 
    take 1 from stack one total: 10
    take 2 from stack two total: 30
    take 3 from stack three total: 60
    take 4 from stack four total: 100
    take 5 from stack five total: 150
    take 6 from stack six total: 210
    take 7 from stack seven total: 280
    take 8 from stack eight total: 360
    take 9 from stack nine total: 450
    take 10 from stack ten total: 550

    then you weight them to check if they are total to 550. If they do not then the first digit represents the stacks from the weight. 
    ex: if total 553 than the fake is stack 3 
    if total is 559 then the fake stack is 9th stack
