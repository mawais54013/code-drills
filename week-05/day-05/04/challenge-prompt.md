The Answer is only 2;
Step 1)
First you divide up the 8 coins into 3 groups with two groups of 3 and one group of 2.

Step 2)
Then you weight the two groups of three
    Step 2a1) If they are balanced then you know the fake has to be in the one group of 2.
    Step 2a2) The you balance the each coin in the group of 2 to find the the fake that is lighter.

    Step2b1) If they are not balanced then you know the fake is in the group of 3 that is lighter. Then move to step 3.

Step 3) You take two coins from the group of 3 and scale them, if they are even then the fake is the third coin that was not balanced. But if they are unbalanced then you know the coin is fake if it is lighter.
